# DevExpress-NuGet

NuGet Packages for the DevExpress .NET Components - [http://www.devexpress.com](http://www.devexpress.com).


## Introduction

> Here are unofficial NuGet specification files (nuspec) that I've created in order to generate NuGet packages for the .NET components developed by [DevExpress](http://www.devexpress.com).

> [If DevExpress ever authorizes me to publicly distribute their assemblies in NuGet packages](https://www.devexpress.com/support/center/Question/Details/S139898), I'll be happy to publish them on the [NuGet.org](http://nuget.org) feed. In the meantime, if you are a DevExpress licensed user, feel free to use these nuspec files to generate the packages and host on your own private/company feed.


### Call To Action
If you too think that [DevExpress](http://www.devexpress.com) should provide us with official NuGet packages for their .NET components, send an e-mail to **<management@devexpress.com>**, or **[post a comment on their forum](https://www.devexpress.com/support/center/Question/Details/S139898)**.  


### Disclaimer from DevExpress
*Please note that according to DevExpress [EULA](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/EULAs/NetComponents.xml), every person working with DevExpress components should have a separate license. To properly register our components on your machine, use the DevExpress installer as described in the [How to activate my DevExpress license article](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/KA18604). Working with DevExpress components using libraries got from NuGet without proper registration may result in licensing violation*.


## Packaging Strategy

I've created one NuGet package specification for every single assembly included in the DevExpress .NET controls, which in turn can be used to generate a NuGet package.

For example, the file `nuspec\Unofficial.DevExpress.Xpf.Ribbon.nuspec` is the corresponding NuGet specification for the assembly `DevExpress.Xpf.Ribbon.v15.1.dll`.


### Dependencies between NuGet packages

The dependencies between NuGet packages are created based on direct references to other DevExpress assemblies.

For example, if the assembly `DevExpress.Xpf.Ribbon.v15.1.dll` directly references `DevExpress.Data.v15.1.dll`, `DevExpress.Mvvm.v15.1.dll` and `DevExpress.Xpf.Core.v15.1.dll`, the NuGet specification will declare a dependency to each of the three NuGet packages corresponding to these assemblies:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2012/06/nuspec.xsd">
      <metadata>
        <id>Unofficial.DevExpress.Xpf.Ribbon</id>
        <version>15.2.4.0</version>
        <!-- ... (omitted for brevity) -->
        <dependencies>
          <group targetFramework=".NETFramework4.0">
            <dependency id="Unofficial.DevExpress.Xpf.Core" version="15.2.4.0" />
            <dependency id="Unofficial.DevExpress.Data" version="15.2.4.0" />
            <dependency id="Unofficial.DevExpress.Mvvm" version="15.2.4.0" />
          </group>
       </dependencies>
      </metadata>
      <files>
        <file src="lib\DevExpress.Xpf.Ribbon.v15.1.dll" target="lib\net40" />
        <file src="lib\DevExpress.Xpf.Ribbon.v15.1.xml" target="lib\net40" />
      </files>
    </package>


## Folder Structure

- **src**
  - **lib**
      - This is where you put the DevExpress assemblies before you generate the NuGet packages. You will typically copy the contents of the folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 15.1\Components\Bin\Framework` and paste it here, including sub-folders;
  - **nupkg**
      - This is the output folder where the NuGet packages will be generated; 
  - **nuspec**
      - This is where all the NuGet specification files are; 
  - **tools**
      - This contains a simple Powershell script used by the NuGet packages related to assemblies that are only needed for design-time (i.e. assemblies in `lib\Design`). This script runs during the installation of these packages only to set the `CopyLocal` attribute of these assemblies to `false`, given that they are not meant to be deployed with the application. 


## How to generate the NuGet packages

To generate all NuGet packages, just run the batch file `src\nuget-pack.cmd`, or if you prefer to manually generate specific packages, just use the `nuget.exe` command line utility. For example:

    nuget.exe pack ".\src\nuspec\Unofficial.DevExpress.Data.nuspec" -BasePath ".\src" -OutputDirectory ".\src\nupkg"


## Known issues / Things to do

- The nuspec files are currently being generated by a quick-and-dirty C# app that I wrote, which is not ready to be shared with the world :). Once I get some free time to rewrite it (or make it a Powershell script), I'll definitely publish it here;

- The language-specific assemblies for German, Spanish, Japanese, and Russian are currently not being included in any of the NuGet packages;

- I use a very specific set of components, which means that there are a number of NuGet packages that I have not extensively tested. You've been warned;

- Instead of generating a NuGet package for every assembly, the script could analyze the dependency chain and build clusters when possible - I'm not sure if it is worth the effort, though. I'm interested in hearing your opinion.

Please [report any issues](https://github.com/CaioProiete/DevExpress-NuGet/issues) you find and I'll try to fix as soon I can, and **remember you can always send a pull-request** ;).
